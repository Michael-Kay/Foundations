1.	Which of the followings is considered boxing?
	c. object myobjx = fx;

2.	Which of the followings is considered unboxing?
	d. int ix = (int) objy;

3.	Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.
	float fx = (float)objdblx;

4.	Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object to another variable of type double.
	double dx = (double)(int)objflx;

5.	Convert the string strx to a double dblx:
	double dblx = (str)strx

6.	Convert the integer ix to a float fx:
	float fx = (float)(int)ix

7.	Convert the double dblx to a string strx:
	string strx = (str)(double)dblx

8.	Object is the MOTHER class of all other data types.

9.	What is an object (the definition)?
	An object has properties and functions that are stored in memory within a class.
10.	A. How do you declare an object in C#? 
	B. What is the difference between an object and a variable?
